@* This component does nothing visual—it simply runs your refresh logic as soon as the app starts up. *@

@inject PharmaTrack.PWA.Helpers.AuthService AuthService

@code {
    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        // Attempt to refresh any stored tokens before the rest of the app renders
        await AuthService.TryRefreshTokenAsync();
